## Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits
Thevenin circuits contain a single voltage source and resistor in series.
Norton circuits contain a single current source and a resistor in parallel

### Equivalent Resistance
$$R_{th} = \frac{V_{th}}{I_{sc}}$$
Any linear network viewed through 2 terminals is replaced with an equivalent single voltage & resistor.

- The equivalent voltage is equal to the open circuit voltage between the two terminals ($V_{oc}/V_{th}$)
- The equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) is found by replacing all sources with their internal impedances and then calculating the impedance of the network, as seen by the two terminals.
  - This can be done alternatively by calculating the short circuit current ($I_{sc}/I_N$) between the two terminals, and then using ohms law: $R_{th} = \frac{V_{th}}{I_{sc}}$.
- The value of the voltage source in a Thevenin circuit is $V_{th}$
- The value of the current source in a Norton circuit is $I_{N}$
- The value of the resistor in either circuit is $R_{th}$

### Thevenin - Norton Conversion
Thevenin and Norton are essentially the same, but in a different form. The $R_th$ is the same for both.
$$I_N = \frac{V_{th}}{R_{th}}$$
- $I_N$ - Norton Current
- $V_{th}$ - Thevevin Voltage
- $R_{th}$ - Thevenin Resistance

## AC Circuits
- AC current is the dominant form of electricity, 
- Current changes direction at a fixed frequency (usually 50~60Hz)
- AC voltage is generated by a rotating electromagnetic field
  - The angular velocity of this rotation determines the frequency of the current

### Instantaneous Voltage
An instantaneous voltage V in a sine wave is described by
$$V = V_p \, \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

Where:
- $V_p$ is the peak voltage
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (rad/s)
- $\phi$ is the phase shift (radians)
- The period of the wave is given by $T = \frac{1}{f} =\frac{ 2\pi}{\omega}$

### Instantaneous Current
As current and voltage are proportional, AC current is defined in a similar way:
$$I = I_p \, \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

### AC Phasor - As complex number
An AC phasor can be represented as a complex number.
$$A \sin (\omega t + \phi) = A \cos \phi + jA \sin \phi = Ae^{j\phi}$$

## Operational Amplifiers

### Output of Inverting Amplifier
The gain of the amplifier is set by the ratio of the two resistors. The negative feedback reverses the polarity of the output voltage (Hence Negative).
$$\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{ - R_{in}}{R_F}$$

![](./img/inv-opamp.png)

### Output of Non-Inverting Amplifier
Non-inverting amplifiers don't invert the voltage output, and use input at the non-inverting terminal of the op amp instead.
$$\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = 1 + \frac{ R_{in}}{R_F}$$

## Filters
### Cutoff Frequncy
The cutoff frequency of a filter is the point at which the gain is equal to -3 dB, which corresponds to a fall in output by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. For the filter shown above, this is:
$$f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi{}R_2C}$$

### Gain (dB)
Gain is measured in decibels
$$20\log\frac{Vout}{Vin}$$

At very low frequencies, the gain is constant (0dB)
The capacitor has high reactance at low frequencies, and is open circuit at very low frequencies
At very high frequencies, the gain tends towards $-\infty$ dB
The capacitor has a very low reactance at high frequencies (short circuit)
